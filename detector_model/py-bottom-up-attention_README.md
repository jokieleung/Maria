# Bottom-up Attention with Detectron2 

The detectron2 system with **exactly the same model and weight** as the Caffe VG Faster R-CNN provided in [bottom-up-attetion](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention).

The original [bottom-up-attetion](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention) is implemented based on [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe), which is not easy to install and is inconsistent with the training code in PyTorch.
Our project thus transfers the weights and models to [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) that could be few-line installed and has PyTorch front-end.

The features extracted from this repo is compatible with LXMERT code and pre-trained models [here](https://github.com/airsplay/lxmert). Results have been locally verified.


## Installation

```

## Demos

### Object Detection

### Feature Extraction 
With Attributes:
1. Single image: [demo extraction](demo/demo_feature_extraction_attr.ipynb)
2. Single image (Given boxes): [demo extraction](demo/demo_feature_extraction_attr_given_box.ipynb)

Without Attributes:
1. Single image: [demo extraction](demo/demo_feature_extraction.ipynb)
2. Single image (Given boxes): [demo extraction](demo/demo_feature_extraction_given_box.ipynb)

## Feature Extraction Scripts for MS COCO
**Note: this script does not include attribute. If you want to use attributes, please modify it according to [the demo](demo/demo_feature_extraction_attr.ipynb)**
1. For MS COCO (VQA): [vqa script](demo/detectron2_mscoco_proposal_maxnms.py)


## Note
1. If the weight is not automatically downloaded, please try manual downloading:
   ```
   wget --no-check-certificate https://nlp1.cs.unc.edu/models/faster_rcnn_from_caffe_attr.pkl -P ~/.torch/fvcore_cache/models/
   wget --no-check-certificate https://nlp1.cs.unc.edu/models/faster_rcnn_from_caffe.pkl -P ~/.torch/fvcore_cache/models/
   ```
2. The default weight is same to the 'alternative pretrained model' in the original github [here](https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention#demo), which is trained with 36 bbxes. If you want to use the original detetion trained with 10~100 bbxes, please use the following weight:

   ```

## Proof of Correctness
1. As shown in [demo](demo/feature_correctness.ipynb)

Note: You might find a little difference between the caffe features and pytorch features in this verification demo. It is because the verification uses the setup "Given box" instead of "Predicted boxes". If the features are extracted from scratch (i.e., features with predicted boxes), they are exactly the same. 

Detailed explanation is here; "Given box" will use feature with the final predicted boxes (after box regression), however, the extracted features will use the features of the proposals. I illustrate this in below:

Feature extraction (using predicted boxes):
```
ResNet --> RPN --> RoiPooling + Res5 --> Box Regression --> BOX
                                      |-------------------> Feature --> Label
                                                                  |-> Attribute
```
Feature extraction (using given boxes):
```
ResNet --> RPN --> RoiPooling + Res5 --> Box Regression --> BOX
                                           |--> RoIPooling + Res5 --> Feature --> Label
                                                                              |-> Attribute
```
